How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    actually it really helps.
    Eventhough I still dont know how Im gonna save so many versions from 1 file
    while editing it,
    I know it s very helpful.
    You were working on a project, you test it once, it works correctly.
    But you made a quite little modification and it's just like that,
    BUF! and it does not work. Where is the error or the typo from?
    who knows!
    If you dont have an old version of the file (and I dont know you could save each single version) you dead fucked up.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I still dont know to access the history of a file. but it sounds so.. great? neat? professional?
    Now I know. You did not say that we have to reflect on each question once we 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I've just saw the video talking about some of the systems that
    save old versions automatically like Dropbox or Google doc.
    Now things become clearer than before. 
    I still dont get the whole idea but now I know that we have not talked about that yet.

      |	pros
    ==+===============================================
    G | -not too many commits and not so few
    i | -all commits have a purpose, and carry meaning
    t | -have that comment thing. It is good

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google doc is not intended to edit, for example, codes and programs
    which are usually in multiple files.
    But in the other hand, Git is dedicated for projects that have so many files that are related between them.
    so if you edit one file, you ll have to edit 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    the basic usage of the two commands is as the following:
    	-for git log, we use it to print the history of the commits (commit id, the comment.. etc). you can add the option --stat to show how many addition/deletion has been made.
    	-git diff requires the commits to be compared ids, and it shows the difference between them, in a great way 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    To answer that, surely I have to apply it on a project and 

    I do not want to answer. I dont know

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I did not configure my workspace.
    I am not in mood to do so.
    I want to use Git for what people use it for.
