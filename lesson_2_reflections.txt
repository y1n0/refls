What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	|
	| When you initialize a repository, Git, like, installs the required things
	| (file )to start tracking your file.
	| Then you need to specify the files to be tracked to Git, so when you 
	| commit, a snapshot of the files will betaken.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	|
	| Staging area allows you minimize the number of files you are tracking 
	| (Git is tracking), when there are files on your working directory that 
	| do not need to be tracked. Staging area is like, for me at least, if it 
	| is not actually like that, a list that contains the names of the files 
	| Git is going to work with.
	| It can't be compared to the working directory or the repository. Even if 
	| they can be confused one with another. I personally used to confuse 
	| between them. But no more :).
	| Working directory is kind of a local repository. While the repository 
	| is the "final" "version" of the project, that you ll share with others.
